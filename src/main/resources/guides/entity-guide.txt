# Here's a guide how to configure this plugin at 'entity-particles.yml'.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# ENTITY PARTICLES
# These particles redraw themselves periodically at the location of the entities.
# This can be considered as Entity cosmetics for best gameplay.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 'target' section guide:
#   type: Can be PLAYER, ZOMBIE, SKELETON, CREEPER, etc. (any valid EntityType name)
#         or ALL_HOSTILE_MOBS.
#   name: (Optional) For PLAYER type, you can specify a single player name. Without writing a player name targets all players.
#   names: (Optional) For PLAYER type, you can specify a list of player names.
#
# 'offset' section guide:
#   x, y, z: (Optional) Offsets the particle effect from the entity's location.
#            'y' is useful for raising effects above the entity's feet.
#
# 'spawn-condition' guide:
#   ALWAYS: The particle will always spawn.
#   STANDING_STILL: The particle will only spawn when the entity is not moving.
#   MOVING: The particle will only spawn when the entity is moving.

    # Caution: Setting period below 10 may cause server lag performance as dropped items are considered as entities.
